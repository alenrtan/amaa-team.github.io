# Problem Statement
--------------------------------------- 

### <br>Purpose of Product<br>
The purpose of this productivity application is to help people store and keep track of tasks set by the user of the program. 
We plan to accomplish this by allowing the users to set custom tasks that the application will store and organize for the user. 
We hope this will help the user have an easier time to keep track of important tasks or events. 
The application will also encourage the user to complete their tasks by giving motivational quotes based on how successful they are at completing them. 
We plan to make this program a beneficial addition to people’s planning process so they can accomplish more and be more efficient with their time.
