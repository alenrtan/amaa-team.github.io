# Architecture
The following image represents the team's decision for the architecture. The AMAA team has decided to use a repository-style architecture with slight 
features from the architectural style of layering. 
The team chose this architecture due to it's simple way of showing how different methods can connect the frontend to the backend. Furthermore, it helps visulize the relationship from top to bottom of the software.
